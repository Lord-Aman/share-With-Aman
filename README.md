# Let's share your files with great ease

SharewithAman - https://share-with-aman.herokuapp.com/

I've had this idea for a while now where people can share thier files which are generally of greater sizes.

In gmail, one can send a file upto a size of < 25MB.

So, Here's shareWithAman -> It allows users to send files upto 500MB. ( Currently it is fixed for 100 MB only)

## :bulb: How it Works

You can simply drag your files inside the drop box, or click on browse to select a file.

It will automatically upload the file and generate a link.

Copy the link and share it to anyone whom you want to send the file.

## :enevelope: Send link as Email

Simply enter the Email address of the recipient and the Sender. It will send the link to the Recipient email address. ( Generally, it is send in the Promotions section)

## :love: Tech Stack Used

Vanilla JS, MongoDB (database), NodeJS , ExpressJS, HTML, CSS. :)
